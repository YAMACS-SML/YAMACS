The purpose of this repository is to add the functionalities of GROMACS and related software to the YASARA Molecular Suite, effectively providing a tool for performing molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS via an interactive and dynamic windowed system.

We envisioned two types of users for YAMACS: **regular users**, who download and use the plugins, and **contributors**, who will help debug and develop new plugins. 

Debugs and new plugins will be evaluated by all active YAMACS contributors.	Users who debug the plugins or create new ones will become **YAMACS Collaborators**, and will be entitled to administer this GitHub repository. 

**Join us and help us create a thriving community to improve YAMACS!**
